    <h1>Hey there! I'm Souptik!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm working on making coding and learning exciting for everyone, inspired by my experiences with Hack Club. 
        My mission is to bring together like-minded coders to learn, grow, and create impactful projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was fortunate to discover my passion for coding and electronics early on. Now, Iâ€™m helping others discover the same joy by 
        building a community that learns and grows together. From personal websites to innovative projects, we do it all!
